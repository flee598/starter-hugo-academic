As part of my Masters work we looked at the role of agricultural land use in facilitating the spread of *Gambusia affinis* (Mosquitofish).

First we looked at how landscape and instream scale factors affected the distribution of Mosquitofish:

**Increasing agricultural land use is associated with the spread of an invasive fish (*Gambusia affinis*)**

Land use change and invasive species pose major threats to ecosystems globally. These stressors can act together, with disturbance due to changes in land use facilitating invasion. We examined the potential for agricultural land use to facilitate the establishment and population growth (abundance) of a globally invasive fish (*Gambusia affinis*). To achieve this we examined *Gambusia* presence, abundance, and life history traits in 31 streams spanning an agricultural land use gradient in the North Island of New Zealand. 

We used regression models to quantify the relationship between agricultural land use and in-stream physiochemical and habitat variables, and zero-inflated models to explore the relationship among physiochemical, habitat and catchment-scale variables and *Gambusia's* distribution and abundance. The percentage of the catchment in agricultural land use was associated with changes to physiochemical and habitat conditions. Increasing agricultural land use was associated with increasing macrophyte cover and water temperature and decreasing velocity in streams. Catchment-scale variables (land use and site position in the network) and water temperature were the most important determinants of whether *Gambusia* occurred at a site. Local in-stream habitat (macrophyte cover and water velocity) and nutrient conditions were the most influential predictors of *Gambusia* abundance given *Gambusia* were present. *Gambusia* life-history traits, sex ratio and body length varied among sites but were not predicted by physiochemical gradients. 

The distribution of *Gambusia* in streams in New Zealand is partially controlled by catchment-scale conditions via a combination of dispersal limitation and environmental filtering, both of which are affected by agricultural land use. Agricultural land use alters local in-stream conditions, resulting in systems that are similar to those in *Gambusia's* natural range; these altered systems have the potential to support an increased abundance of *Gambusia*. This study provides preliminary quantitative evidence that agricultural land use is related to the spread of a globally invasive freshwater fish.

Then we looked at how agricultural land use affected the diet of Mosquitofish:

**Prey selectivity and ontogenetic diet shift of the globally invasive western mosquitofish (*Gambusia affinis*) in agriculturally impacted streams**

The dietary breadth of invaders can influence their success, and having a wide dietary niche can facilitate the spread and survival of invaders under a variety of resource scenarios. The western mosquitofish (*Gambusia affinis*) is a globally distributed freshwater invasive fish. The spread of *G. affinis* is associated with agricultural land use, although the trophic role it plays in degraded systems is not well understood. 

We analysed the invertebrate community in 11 stream reaches in the North Island of New Zealand, in catchments spanning a range (45%â€“90%) of agricultural land use to determine how prey availability changes with land use. We then analysed the gut contents of 400 *G. affinis* from the 11 sites to determine how diet varied with prey availability and ontogeny. Invertebrate communities varied along the agricultural land use gradient, both in regard to taxonomic richness and community composition. *G. affinis* consumed a wide variety of food items with invertebrates being the most dominant, in particular Culicidae, Copepods and amphipods were the most commonly consumed invertebrates. There was also an ontogenetic diet shift from microinvertebrates (Cladocera, Copepods and diatoms) to larger invertebrates, including Culicidae, amphipods and terrestrial invertebrates.

*G. affinis* are capable of consuming a wide variety of prey in agricultural streams; their preferred prey are generally pollution-tolerant taxa commonly found in degraded streams. Having a large level of dietary plasticity coupled with preferring prey that are often associated with degraded systems likely facilitates to the spread of one of the most widely distributed freshwater invasive fish.
