As part of my Masters work we looked at the role of agricultural land use in facilitating the spread of *Gambusia affinis* (mosquitofish). 

First we examined network genrating algorithms xxx

In the second part of my PhD we presented a mechaistic model of a fish metacommunity

We then used the model above to examine how spatiotemoral aspects fo aconnectivity affect patterns of species richness

Finally, we examined how intercatchment connectivity, facilitated by amphidromy of the upkororo may have contributed to the species extinction.
