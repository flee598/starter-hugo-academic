Fish disperse throughout and between the world’s rivers and oceans, transporting nutrients and energy across biomes. Many humans depend on predictable fish migrations between freshwater and the ocean for recreation, subsistence and livelihoods, but these migratory species are vulnerable to multiple interacting threats that play out from land to sea (Arthington et al., 2016; Munsch et al., 2020). New Zealand’s whitebait fishery relies on catching juvenile fish as they return to rivers from the sea (an ‘amphidromous’ life cycle). Of the five species that make up the whitebait catch, four are threatened with extinction, and there is concern that they will soon be lost (some are already on the cusp of regional extinction; such as the short-jaw kōkopu, which has all but disappeared from the north-west coast of the South Island). Proposed solutions to this situation have emphasised the role of fishing in driving the declines and are targeted towards fishers (Department of Conservation, 2020). We believe this focus on fishing pressure overlooks other key contributing stressors. There needs to be a greater focus on pressures affecting adult fish (Eikaas & McIntosh, 2006), coupled with a better understanding of the dynamics among connected populations across the landscape (metapopulations). We aim to address these knowledge gaps by developing models that can be used to tease apart the relative effect of different stressors and help inform management actions.


**Key objectives**

1. Whitebait have historically been managed at the level of local populations, but we know that the species’ function as metapopulations given their amphidromous dispersal and non-natal homing behaviour (Hickford & Schiel, 2016; Franklin & Gee, 2019). The supply of juveniles to rivers partly determines adult abundance, but the importance of juvenile supply relative to events occurring during or after entry into freshwater is not clear (recruitment limitation vs density-dependent processes). We will use whitebait as a model system to determine the relative strengths of these two processes in determining extinction risk for metapopulations of amphidromous fish.


2. Metapopulation models will be parametrised for each of Aoteroa's whitebait species, and used to evaluate how whitebait persistence is affected by various management interventions. The models will include interventions being considered by the government around fishing regulations and those that have received less attention regarding the adult life-stage (e.g. habitat restoration, controlling trout).  


3. There is a lack of accessible tools available to managers and stakeholders and a lack of understanding as to which interventions are most significant in driving whitebait population recovery and management. To address this issue, we will convert our model(s) into a web-based application. This web-app will allow stakeholders to explore management scenarios to understand what the most effective interventions are likely to be.
