As part of my Masters work we looked at the role of agricultural land use in facilitating the spread of *Gambusia affinis* (Mosquitofish). 

First we examined how landscape and instream scale factors affected the distribution of Mosquitofish. We found the distribution of *Gambusia* in streams in New Zealand is partially controlled by catchment-scale conditions via a combination of dispersal limitation and environmental filtering, both of which are affected by agricultural land use. Agricultural land use alters local in-stream conditions, resulting in systems that are similar to those in *Gambusia's* natural range; these altered systems have the potential to support an increased abundance of *Gambusia*. This study provides preliminary quantitative evidence that agricultural land use is related to the spread of a globally invasive freshwater fish.

In the second part of my MSc we looked at how agricultural land use affected the diet of Mosquitofish. We found that *G. affinis* were capable of consuming a wide variety of prey in agricultural streams; their preferred prey are generally pollution-tolerant taxa commonly found in degraded streams. Having a large level of dietary plasticity coupled with preferring prey that are often associated with degraded systems likely facilitates to the spread of one of the most widely distributed freshwater invasive fish.
