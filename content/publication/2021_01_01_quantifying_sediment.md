abstract: "Predictions of sediment flux and the evolutionary trajectory of river systems cannot be conducted effectively independent from quantitative understandings of sediment (dis)connectivity. This requires analysis of structural and functional interactions within and between landscape compartments, and the way these interactions play out at the catchment scale. Building upon a conceptualization of connected and disconnected landscapes, this chapter reviews recent modeling applications that quantify these cross-scalar relationships, highlighting applications in different settings. A summary of approaches to analysis of ecological (dis)connectivity relationships in river systems highlights significant prospects for future interdisciplinary research applications."
